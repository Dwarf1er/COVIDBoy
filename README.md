# COVIDBoy
This is the repository for Assignment 2 of COMP 376 - Introduction to Game Development Fall 2021 at Concordia University. This assignment is taking inspiration from the 1985 arcade game [Paperboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy_(video_game)) but taking it to the modern context of the COVID-19 pandemic. You are playing a decontaminator, your job is to cleanse the platforms and throw masks at pedestrians to prevent the spread of the virus. This 2D side-scroller platform game is never ending and contains 2 game modes! Beware, you will lose if the virus spreads too much.

## Art

All of the visuals were created by the author using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and the characters were based on a royalty free sprite template sheet. The reference material is linked at the end of this README.

## Normal Game Mode

- Cleaned platforms give you 2 points
- Missed platforms make you lose 1 point
- You lose if your score gets to -20

## New Game Plus Game Mode

- Cleaned platforms give you 1 point
- Missed platforms make you lose 2 points
- Pressing Q will double your movement speed for 3 seconds, this ability can be activated every 10 seconds
- You lose if your score gets to -20
